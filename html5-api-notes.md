    - Contacts - The HTML5 specification mentions that the Contacts API allows to have a common contacts repository in the browser which can be access by any web application.
    - Selection - The selection API supports selecting items in DOM (supports CSS3 type of selectors), to be used along with JQUERY.
    - Offline apps - This API allows marking pages to be available in Offline mode. This is useful if a resource requires dynamic processing.
    - Indexed database - This API is meant for a database of records holding simple values (including hierarchical objects). Every record has a key and a value. An indexed database is supposed to be implemented using b-trees. Web SQL DB is no longer being pursued as part of HTML5 specification.
    - Web workers - This API is meant to be invoked by web application to spawn background workers to execute scripts which run in parallel to UI page. The concept of web works is similar to worker threads which get spawned for tasks which need to invoked separate from the UI thread.
